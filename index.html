  <p class="ex1"><pre>Virtual Reality is well known for its use in gaming and other forms of recreational activities, 
and if it is not being used for personal enjoyment, it is typically linked to stereotypical STEM related fields of occupation. 
However, while virtual reality might have a predominant use within the fields of computer science and other STEM related subjects, 
there are, in fact, other uses for it outside of these areas. As technology advances, more and more research is going into the potential 
applications of virtual reality, leading to an increase in papers on the topic along with more experiments being performed on its uses.</pre></p>

Barker’s article (1993)<a href="#[1]" class="noLine"><sup>[1]</sup></a>  defined Virtual Reality as: 

“A VR system is a sophisticated multimedia environment in which users are exposed to, and can participate in,
surrogate tacto-audio-visual experiences. These experiences are created by means of a computer system to which are 
attached special types of peripheral device, enabling users to interact with the real and artificial objects that 
exist within the interaction environment.”

The use of virtual reality has been increasing at a rapid rate throughout these last few years. 
Though known primarily for its use of recreational activities such as gaming, the potential, and in some cases actual,
uses for this technology are far more diverse. Virtual reality has been expanding beyond the field of Computer Science,
first into other similarly related fields such as Engineering or Robotics, yet in more recent years it can be seen in 
the fields of healthcare, architecture or even education.

Table 1 and Figure 1 both show the increase in literature of virtual reality in fields outside of computer science.

The increase in literary articles on the topic of Virtual Reality implies the
emergence of various new applications in the field, or at least research into
new ways of utilizing this ever evolving technology. According to Figure 1,
virtual reality is still most commonly being researched in STEM related fields,
however one can see that along the edges of the word map other fields such as: 
Geography or Hospitality.

The paper opens with a breakdown of the different components that they would
need to make thispossible, and about how with recent advancements in
technology the price of some necessary equipment has fallen. This would therefore
mean that one of the limiting factors that prevents a lot of technological
advancements, a lack of affordable parts, would no longer be as big of an issue.

  This paper represents a clear indication of a practical use of virtual reality
  which has visibility positive effects in an academic environment. This therefore
  shows just how virtual reality has little in the way of limitations on it’s uses
  beyond that of recreational activities, other than our own creativity in
  acknowledging and taking advantage of this rapidly evolving piece of technology.
